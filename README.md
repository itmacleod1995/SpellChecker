# SpellChecker
This small project acts as a spellchecker, where the user enters a word or sentence and the program states which words are spelled incorrectly. 

The project involves a repository of roughly 100,000 English words contained in a file. The program reads the file in, inserting each word efficiently O(log n) into a tree data structure.
